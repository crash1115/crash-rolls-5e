## What is this?
A module for Foundry VTT that gives you more fine control over what the roll flow looks like, without the need for a huge complex module that messes with a ton of things. Each user has the ability to set the following toggles for themselves:
- Automatically roll attacks
- Automatically roll attack damage
- Automatically roll non-attack damage and healing
- Automatically roll other formulas
- Skip attack dialogs
- Skip damage dialogs
- Skip abilitiy check dialogs
- Skip save dialogs
- Skip skill check dialogs
- Skip tool check dialogs

## Known Issues
- Enabling RSR-Style Shortcut Keys does not fast-forward rolls when Alt is held (it rolls at advantage instead). Shift and Ctrl roll advantage and disadvantage as expected.

## Credits
- This module is derived in part from the [Faster Rolling by Default DnD5e](https://github.com/ElfFriend-DnD/foundryvtt-faster-rolling-by-default-5e) module.
- This module re-uses some code from the [dnd5e](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e) system.
